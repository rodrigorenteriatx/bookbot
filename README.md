# Character Count and Word Count Report

## Overview

This is a small Python project that reads a text file, analyzes its content, and generates a report containing the count of words and the occurrences of each alphabetic character in the text.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository or download the Python script (`character_count_report.py`).

3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.

4. Execute the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python character_count_report.py
    ```

5. The script will read the text file located at `books/frankenstein.txt` by default. You can change the `book_path` variable in the `main()` function to specify a different file.

6. The script will generate a report containing the count of words and the occurrences of each alphabetic character in the text file.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Python script (`character_count_report.py`) with the following functions:

- **`get_book_text(path)`:** This function reads the contents of a text file located at the specified path and returns the text as a string.

- **`get_num_words(text)`:** This function takes a text string as input and returns the number of words in the text.

- **`get_dict_letters(text)`:** This function takes a text string as input, counts the occurrences of each alphabetic character (case-insensitive), and returns a dictionary containing the character counts.

- **`print_report(text, book_path)`:** This function takes the text content of a book and its file path as input, generates a report containing the count of words and the occurrences of each alphabetic character, and prints the report to the console.

- **`main()`:** This function serves as the entry point of the program. It sets the path to the text file, retrieves the text content, and generates and prints the report.

## Example Report

An example report generated by the script for the text file `frankenstein.txt` is as follows:

```
--- Begin report of books/frankenstein.txt ---

63551 words found in the document
The 'e' character was found 94412 times
The 't' character was found 67257 times
The 'a' character was found 60500 times
...
...
The 'j' character was found 552 times

--- End report ---
```
